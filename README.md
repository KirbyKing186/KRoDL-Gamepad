# KRoDL-Gamepad
This is version 1.0 of the ROM hack "Kirby's Revenge of Dream Land", now with gamepad support and a home menu forwarder. Previous Kirby's Return to Dream Land save data syncs with this ROM hack. Made using UWUVCI and Wiimm's WUT tool.
## Steps
1. Extract "KRodL" and place the folder inside `SD:\\install`. If the folder does not exist, create it.
2. Download WUP Installer GX2 or another trustable WUP downloader.
3. Click "Install" on the package and wait until the installation is complete.
4. Go to the home menu using the home button, and click A on the new icon.
5. Click `Use gamepad` when the prompt comes up.
6. Choose whether to display on TV or only gamepad.
7. Enjoy!
## Controls
B: 2

Y: 1

L & R: A

D-Pad: D-Pad

The rest of the buttons are not supported as of now, and are not needed to progress the game.
## Notes:
Wii remote cursor emulation will most likely never be applied for gamepad support. It is only needed for a few optional minigames that do not impact 100% completion. 

The circle pad has not been implemented yet, and it will be extremley difficult to support.

The WiiU gamepad cannot be shaken in parts that need it. Instead, use the D-Pad.
